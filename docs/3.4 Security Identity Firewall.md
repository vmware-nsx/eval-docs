## Security -- Identity Firewall Introduction

In this section, we will go through how to configure and test NSX
Distributed Firewall Identity Firewall capabilities for
micro-segmentation. Identity Firewall, just like Distributed Firewall,
does not require Overlay networking and can be done on a VLAN-backed
Segment. The following example will use Overlay networking but note this
is not a requirement.

NSX-T Identity Firewall works for both single user and multi-user (Microsoft Remote Desktop Server Host) use cases.
