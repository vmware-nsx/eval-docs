## 3.3. Operation Tools

In this section, you'll use 2 popular Operation tools which greatly facilitate Network and Security admins:
  - Network Topology
  - Traceflow

*The Operation evaluation done in this chapter is focusing on those 2 tools.  
NSX-T offers more than those tools, such as Port Mirroring, IPFIX, Syslog, advanced status and statistics on its different services.*

### 3.3.1. Network Topology

What has been created so far is the following logical topology:

</p>  

NSX offers a graphical representation of its network topology.
- **Log on NSX-T Manager UI.**  
In a browser: https://192.168.50.5/.  
  <p align="center">

  </p>  

- **Display the NSX Network Topology.**  
Under "Networking - Network Topology".  
<p align="center">
  <img width=85% height=85% src="/docs/assets/Graphics/3.3.1.step1.jpg"><br>

- **And specific Network elements, such as T0 information.**

### 3.3.2. Traceflow

<details>
<summary>"Click to expand"</summary>

Traceflow allows you to inject a packet into the network and monitor its flow across the network.  
Traceflow allows you to identify the path a packet takes to reach its destination or, conversely, where a packet is dropped along the way.  
Each entity reports the packet handling on input and output, so you can determine whether issues occur when receiving a packet or when forwarding the packet.

- **Check the Traceflow from VM3 HTTP to VM7.**  
<details>
<summary>"Click to expand"</summary>  

Under "Plan & Troubleshoot - Traceflow",  
select the Source "LS1.1-VM3",  
to Destination "LS2.1-VM7",  
Protocol Type "TCP" with Source Port = "5000" to Destination Port = "80".   
<p align="center">
  <img width=85% height=85% src="/docs/assets/Graphics/3.3.2.step1.jpg"><br>
</p>  
And click "Trace".  

You can follow the path through the different Logical NSX Routing + Security elements on the top half of the screen.  
<p align="center">
  <img width=85% height=85% src="/docs/assets/Graphics/3.3.2.step2.jpg"><br>
</p>  
  
You can also follow each step of the different NSX elements on the bottom half of the screen (and on which device it's running).  
<p align="center">
  <img width=85% height=85% src="/docs/assets/Graphics/3.3.2.step3.jpg"><br>
</p>  
  
*Note: Worth nothing even if that traffic is routed, it actually does not leave the ESXi1 (192.168.50.21) thanks to the power of NSX service distribution :-)*

</details>


- **Check the Traceflow from VM3 HTTP to VM1.**  
<details>
<summary>"Click to expand"</summary>  

Under "Plan & Troubleshoot - Traceflow",  
select the Source "LS1.1-VM3",  
to Destination "VLANWeb-VM1",  
Protocol Type "TCP" with Source Port = "5000" to Destination Port = "80".  
<p align="center">
  <img width=85% height=85% src="/docs/assets/Graphics/3.3.2.step4.jpg"><br>
</p>  
And click "Trace".  
  
You can follow the path through the different Logical NSX Routing + Security elements on the top half of the screen.  
<p align="center">
  <img width=85% height=85% src="/docs/assets/Graphics/3.3.2.step2.jpg"><br>
</p>  
  
You can also follow each step of the different NSX elements on the bottom half of the screen (and on which device it's running).  
<p align="center">
  <img width=85% height=85% src="/docs/assets/Graphics/3.3.2.step3.jpg"><br>
</p>  
  
*Note: The traceflow tracks the different NSX elements up to it reaches the physical fabric, and ends there.*
