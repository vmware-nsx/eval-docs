### Overview
NSX-T Services evaluated in that Evaluation Guide:
- Security Services
  - Micro-Segmentation (DFW)
  - Identity Firewall
- Logical Networking Services
  - Logical Switching
  - Logical Routing (with distributed routing)
- Operation tools
  - Network Topology
  - Traceflow




NSX offers many more services, such as Load Balancing, VPN, IDS, NSX Intelligence, Federation, etc.  
Those are currently out of scope of that document.  

Also to limit the ESXi/Storage requirements, this evaluation does not cover high-availability and only 1 element of each NSX component will be installed.
